# Joint Business Plan

Turn a strategic partnership into written commitments both sides sign and review.

## When to Use

- A partner reaches the Strategic tier
- Annual planning with an existing strategic partner
- Resetting a partnership that has activity but no shared targets
- Preparing for an executive sponsor meeting

## What You'll Need

**Critical inputs (ask if not provided):**

- The partner's name and the planning period
- Last period's results: sourced won, influenced won, joint customers
- Each side's top priority for the period

**Nice-to-have:**

- Output of `partner-eco score`, `overlap`, and `attribution` for this partner
- Last period's plan and what was delivered
- Integration roadmap items on either side

## Process

### Step 1: Establish the baseline

```bash
python -m partner_ecosystem score data/partners.csv --partner "Northwind Data"
python -m partner_ecosystem attribution data/opportunities.csv --partner "Northwind Data"
```

State where the partnership is today in numbers. Targets without a baseline cannot be judged later.

### Step 2: Agree two or three shared goals

Each goal needs a metric, a target, and a date. Prefer goals that both sides are measured on internally; those get resourced.

### Step 3: Pick the target accounts

```bash
python -m partner_ecosystem overlap data/our_accounts.csv data/partner_accounts.csv --partner "Northwind Data" --opportunities data/opportunities.csv
```

Choose ten to twenty named accounts with a play and an owner on each side. Fewer accounts with owners beat a long list without them.

### Step 4: List investments from each side

Write both columns. Typical items: integration work, enablement and certification, marketing funds, executive time, dedicated sellers. An empty column means it is not a joint plan.

### Step 5: Set governance

Name the executive sponsors, the working leads, the review cadence, and how a missed commitment is escalated.

### Step 6: Record risks and dependencies

Include roadmap dependencies, competing partnerships on either side, and organizational changes.

## Governance
- Executive sponsors:
- Working leads:
- Cadence: weekly pipeline, quarterly review

## Risks and dependencies
## Sign-off
```

## Guardrails

- Keep it to two pages. A plan nobody rereads is not a plan.
- Every target needs a baseline and an owner.
- Do not write commitments for the partner that they have not agreed to; mark them as proposed.
- Keep sourced and influenced targets separate.
